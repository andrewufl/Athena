# 🐕 Albert Product Overview

## 📌 Overview

**Albert** is an AI-powered Slack outreach automation tool designed to help users generate **leads and convert prospects** inside Slack workspaces. Much like LinkedIn tools (e.g. Dux-Soup, PhantomBuster), but purpose-built for the **Slack ecosystem**, Albert enables users to create bots that join Slack communities, send targeted messages, and hold intelligent conversations with prospects.

Our mission is to help sales and marketing teams engage prospects **where they work**—on Slack—using AI to maintain human-like interactions at scale.
